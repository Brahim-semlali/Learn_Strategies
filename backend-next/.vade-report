# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation Report

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for the Next.js application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` version ^1.3.1 using npm
- Updated package.json to include the new dependency
- Updated package-lock.json with the new package and its 76 dependencies

### 2. Layout Component Update (app/layout.tsx)
- Imported `SpeedInsights` component from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'
- Updated the RootLayout component to include proper HTML structure:
  - Added `<html lang="en">` wrapper
  - Added `<body>` tag
  - Placed `<SpeedInsights />` component after {children} inside the body tag
- This follows the recommended pattern for Next.js 13.5+ with App Router

### 3. Next.js Configuration Update
- next-env.d.ts was automatically updated by Next.js build process (routes reference changed from dev to production)

## Files Modified
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added SpeedInsights component and proper HTML structure
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated lockfile with new dependency tree
- `next-env.d.ts` - Automatically updated by Next.js

## Verification
✓ Build completed successfully using `npm run build`
✓ TypeScript type checking passed with no errors
✓ All changes staged with git
✓ No build artifacts staged (tsconfig.tsbuildinfo excluded)

## Implementation Notes
- The project uses Next.js 16.1.6 (Turbopack) with App Router, which is newer than 13.5
- Used the recommended import path '@vercel/speed-insights/next' for App Router
- The SpeedInsights component is placed after {children} as recommended
- No additional configuration is needed; the component will automatically track page views and performance metrics when deployed to Vercel

## Testing
The implementation was verified by:
1. Running `npm run build` - completed successfully with no errors
2. Running `npx tsc --noEmit` - TypeScript type checking passed
3. All routes compiled successfully including 12 API routes and static pages
